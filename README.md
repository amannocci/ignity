- Allow high inheritance

## :hammer: Workflow

### Setup

The following steps will ensure your project is cloned properly.

1. `git clone https://github.com/amannocci/ignity`
2. `cd ignity && task setup`

### Test

- To test you have to use the workflow script.

```bash
task test
```

- It will test project code with the current environment.

### Package

- To package you have to use the workflow script.

```bash
task package
```

- It will create a tar archive containing ignity.

## 📖 Usage

### How it works

- We use `s6` as supervision suite.
- `ignity` is a wrapper around `s6`.
- There are three different stage.
- The first stage is responsible of set up container environment.
- It will create `ignity` runtime directories.
- Load & merge defined variables.
- The second stage will then run `perms` & `init` scripts.
- If everything is alright then it will start all services.
- If a command is defined, it will run after a defined delay and then exit.
- If a command isn't defined, it will run forever until a explicit signal or a crash.
- The third stage is responsible to bringing down the container.
- It will stop services and in parallel will run `finalize` scripts.
- It will then kill everything and exit.

### How to integrate ignity in your project from source

- You can simply `git clone` the project in the scope of the dockerfile.
- And then build your image as usual.

```Dockerfile
# Install ignity from source
COPY ignity/src /
RUN bash /usr/src/install-ignity.sh \
```

### How to use ignity as `ENTRYPOINT`

- By default, `ignity` isn't set as entrypoint.
- If you want to use it to handle services and all specifics stuff you have to explicitly define it as entrypoint.

```bash
ENTRYPOINT [ "/init" ]
```

### How to use ignity with a `CMD`

- Using `CMD` is a really convenient way to take advantage of `ignity`.
- Your `CMD` can be given at build-time in the Dockerfile, or at runtime on the command line, either way is fine.
- It will be run under the s6 supervisor, and when it fails or exits, the container will exit. You can even run interactive programs under the s6 supervisor !

### How to load env files

- Sometimes it's interesting to load env files to define default variables.
- You can simply put any env files in `/etc/ignity/envs` and they will be loaded during runtime in order.
- They will be overrided by container environments variables.

### How to supervise a service

- Creating a supervised service cannot be easier
- Just create a service directory with the name of your service into `/etc/ignity/services`
- Put a `run` file into it, this is the file in which you'll put your long-lived process execution
- You're done! If you want to know more about s6 supervision of servicedirs take a look to [`servicedir`](https://skarnet.org/software/s6/servicedir.html) documentation.

### How to run hook on service exit

- By default, services created in `/etc/ignity/services` will automatically restart.
- If a service should bring the container down, you'll need to write a `finish` script that does that.

`/etc/ignity/services/myapp/finish`:

```
#!/bin/execlineb -S0

s6-svscanctl -t /run/ignity/services-state
```

- It's possible to do more advanced operations.

`/etc/ignity/services/myapp/finish`:

```
#!/bin/execlineb -S1
if { eltest ${1} -ne 0 }
if { eltest ${1} -ne 256 }

s6-svscanctl -t /run/ignity/services-state
```

### How to start a service on-demand

- By default, all services are started at runtime.
- You can delay or disable automatic start by creating a `down` file in the [service directory](https://skarnet.org/software/s6/servicedir.html).
- This file can be created at build time in `/etc/ignity/services/myapp/down`.
- Or at runtime by creating the file in `/run/ignity/services/myapp/down` using init scripts.
- Note that after first services start the service directory is `/run/ignity/services-state` instead of `/run/ignity/services`.
- Then you can start it manually by removing the file in `/run/ignity/services-state/myapp/down` and by calling `s6-svc -u /run/ignity/services-state/myapp`.

### How to execute initialization and/or finalization tasks

- Just before starting user provided services.
- `ignity` will execute in order all scripts present in `/etc/ignity/init`.
- And in parallel of bringing down user provided services.
- `ignity` will execute in order all scripts present in `/etc/ignity/finalize`.
- You can use this mecanism to setup the container or validate everything or clean some resources before container exit.

### How to set container environment variables

- If you want your custom script to have container environments available just make use of `with-env` helper, which will push all of those into your execution environment, for example:

`/etc/ignity/init/01-example`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/with-env sh
echo $MYENV
```

- This script will output whatever the `MYENV` enviroment variable contains.
- This helper is only here for custom environments variables pushed in `/run/ignity/envs` directory.

### How to run a container with non root user

- To run a container with a non root user, you have to define files and directories permissions in `perms` and then define the following in the Dockerfile

```bash
ENV \
  USERMAP_UID="1000" \
  USERMAP_GID="1000" \
  USER="exploit"
RUN preboot
USER ${USERMAP_UID}:${USERMAP_GID}
```

- This will correct permissions at build time instead of runtime and will let the container start properly with a non root user.

### How to run a container in read-only mode

- To run the container in read-only mode, you will have to mount a tmpfs at `/run/ingity`.
- If you want to run it with a non root user, you will also need to match uid able to write, execute and read on this location.

```yaml
tmpfs:
  - "/run/ignity:exec,mode=1777,uid=<uid>"
```

### How to fix ownership & permissions

- Sometimes it's interesting to fix ownership & permissions before proceeding because, for example, you have mounted/mapped a host folder inside your container.
- Ignity provides a way to tackle this issue using files in `/etc/ignity/perms`.
- The pattern format followed by fix-perms files:

```text
path recurse account fmode dmode
> /var/lib/mysql 1000:1000 0600 0700
```

- `path`: File or dir path.
- `account`: Target account `uid:gid`.
- `fmode`: Target file mode. For example, `0644`.
- `dmode`: Target dir/folder mode. For example, `0755`.

- You can use variables `{{USERMAP_UID}}` and `{{USERMAP_GID}}` in those files.
- They will be replaced at runtime or build time based on case.
- You can also skip the permission phase by using `IGNITY_SKIP_PERMS=1`

### How to drop privileges

- When it comes to executing a service, no matter it's a service or a logging service, a very good practice is to drop privileges before executing it.
- `s6` already includes utilities to do exactly these kind of things:

In `execline`:

```sh
#!/bin/execlineb -P
s6-setuidgid daemon
myapp
```

In `sh`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
exec s6-setuidgid daemon myservice
```

- If you want to know more about these utilities, please take a look to: [`s6-setuidgid`](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-setuidgid.html), [`s6-envuidgid`](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-envuidgid.html) and [`s6-applyuidgid`](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-applyuidgid.html).

### How to allow high inheritance

- It's convenient to prefix every scripts in `envs`, `perms`, `init` and `finalize` by number (two chars) to ensure execution order.
- A common pattern is to dedicated 10 number by docker image layer to allow logic evolution.

### How to customize `ignity` behaviour

It is possible somehow to tweak `ignity` behaviour by providing an already predefined set of environment variables to the execution context:

- `IGNITY_CMD_WAIT_FOR_SERVICES_MAXTIME` (default = 5000): The maximum time (in milliseconds) the services could take to bring up before proceding to CMD executing.
- `IGNITY_CMD_WAIT_FOR_SERVICES` (default = 0): In order to proceed executing CMD overlay will wait until services are up. Be aware that up doesn't mean ready. Depending if `notification-fd` was found inside the servicedir overlay will use `s6-svwait -U` or `s6-svwait -u` as the waiting statement.
- `IGNITY_KILL_FINALIZE_MAXTIME` (default = 5000): The maximum time (in milliseconds) a script in `/etc/ignity/finalize` could take before sending a `KILL` signal to it. Take into account that this parameter will be used per each script execution, it's not a max time for the whole set of scripts.
- `IGNITY_KILL_GRACETIME` (default = 3000): How long (in milliseconds) `ignity` should wait to reap zombies before sending a `KILL` signal.
- `IGNITY_SERVICES_GRACETIME` (default = 5000): How long (in milliseconds) `ignity` should wait to reap zombies before sending a down signal.
